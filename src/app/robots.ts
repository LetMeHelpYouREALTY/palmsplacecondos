/**
 * Google honors User-agent, Allow, Disallow, and Sitemap only.
 * Do not emit `Host:` — it is a Yandex leftover and Search Console flags it as
 * the robots.txt warning on every protocol/host variant it fetches.
 * Canonical host is https://www via redirects + sitemap URLs, not this file.
 *
 * Search Console cannot upload this file. Recrawl-from-GSC may fail with a
 * generic retry error; this route is force-dynamic so Google's next fetch is
 * not stuck on a 4-hour CDN copy of an older robots.txt.
 *
 * Extra AI crawler groups use the same Allow/Disallow as `*` so answer engines
 * can fetch marketing HTML. Do not add unsupported fields.
 *
 * Production `https://www.palmsplacecondos.com/robots.txt` (fetched 2026-08-20,
 * before Claude-User/Claude-SearchBot were added below) matched this module:
 * Allow `/`, Disallow `/api/`, AI crawler group, and
 * `Sitemap: https://www.palmsplacecondos.com/sitemap.xml`. That Disallow keeps
 * `/api/indexnow` off crawlers; the IndexNow key file is at `/{key}.txt` (root,
 * allowed). Do not add `Host:`.
 *
 * @see https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt
