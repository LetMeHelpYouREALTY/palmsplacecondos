    question: "Who should consider a Palms Place studio?",
    answer:
      "Studios fit buyers who want Strip-adjacent lock-and-leave use, a second home, or a lower buy-in than larger one-bedroom layouts—if they accept a single main living zone and less storage. On tours, we focus on closet volume, kitchen layout, noise from neighbors above or beside, and whether furniture included in the sale matches how you actually live.",

  {
    id: "who-one-bed",
    question: "Who should consider a one-bedroom at Palms Place?",
    answer:
      "One-bedroom layouts help when you want a separated sleeping area, more frequent hosting, or a clearer long-term primary residence feel. Assess whether the den or dining niche is truly usable—not just a marketing photo angle—and compare monthly assessment against studios on the same floor band when possible.",
  },
  {
    id: "penthouse-layer",
    question: "How do penthouse-style units differ from mid-tower studios and one-bedrooms?",
    answer:
      "Upper floors add view, ceiling height, and outdoor space variables that mid-tower units do not offer. They also bring different buyer competition and longer document review. Treat each penthouse listing as its own comp set—do not assume it follows studio pricing trends.",
  },
  {
    id: "furnished-impact",
    question: "Does furnished vs unfurnished change which unit type you should buy?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Furnished studios can look spacious with hotel-style built-ins; unfurnished one-bedrooms can feel smaller once your furniture arrives. Always tour the exact unit you are buying and read the inventory list before you assume a floor plan “type” will feel the same as a prior stay.",
