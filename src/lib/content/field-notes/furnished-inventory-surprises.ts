    "A furnished Palms Place unit can show beautifully on a Saturday tour and still close with disputes over wine fridges, wall-mounted TVs, or custom window treatments. This note explains how our listing team documents conveyance before MLS photos go live—so buyers are not negotiating furniture on the eve of closing.",
